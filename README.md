# Recommendation-system

Exploring recommendation systems

2 artists : BTS and EXO, so one dataset for each. Both datasets contain the same variables, ie Spotify audio features found on the API for Spotify developpers. 
Audio features description : https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-feature 
  
Goal : To recommend BTS songs to someone who listens to EXO, or the other way around.
